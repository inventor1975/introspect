fixbench — measure the tool against SECURITY FIXES the authors made themselves.

A labelled corpus tells you whether the instrument sees what a generator planted. This tells you
something the generator cannot: whether it sees what a real developer, in real code, later admitted
was a hole. The ground truth is the project's own history — a commit whose message says it fixes a
security problem — so it depends neither on a CVE database nor on anyone's memory.

For each such commit the tool runs on the tree BEFORE and the tree AFTER, over the files that
commit touched, and the pair is classified:

    CAUGHT      a REFUTED in a touched file before, and it is gone after
    STILL       REFUTED before and after — our verdict is about something the fix did not address
    MISSED      the touched files have sinks and every one came back EARNED — we said CLEAN where the
                author later escaped: a real miss
    OPENED      no REFUTED, but OPEN verdicts on those files: we named the place and refused to
                judge it. Not a hit and not silence — measured 2026-09-09, this is most of what
                looked like silence, and it is nearly always a value read back out of the database
                (`get_option`), where our answer is Z by policy
    NO-SINK     the touched files contain no sink at all — the vulnerable call is elsewhere, and
                there is nothing here for this instrument to judge
    NOISE       no REFUTED before, some after — the fix introduced a shape we dislike

CAUGHT is the only class that counts as a hit, and even it is coarse: it says the verdict moved
with the fix, not that our reasoning matched the developer's. Read the pair before claiming one.
