"""
The stand for php2zfl. Three kinds of control, and all three are needed:

  POSITIVE   planted injections must come back REFUTED — an instrument that
             cannot see a known-present instance has no right to report absence;
  NEGATIVE   clean code must come back EARNED, opaque code OPEN;
  VACUITY    with the sanitizer catalog emptied, f02 must flip to OPEN (unknown fn = Z), and
             with the source catalog emptied, f01 must flip to OPEN — proving the
             catalog is load-bearing and the verdicts are not the frame talking.
