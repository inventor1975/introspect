# php2zfl — code → atoms → ZFL2 → the judge

A model cannot lay a text out into atoms without losing some. Code is
different: a parser lays it out exactly. So here the atomizer is an
**algorithm** — `atoms.php` on `nikic/php-parser` — and the only judge is
the **ZTL core** (`tool/zfl.py`, the same `run` the studio calls). No model
is called anywhere; a run costs milliseconds and no key.

## What it answers

For every **sink** (a query, a shell call, an include…) one question:

> can an attacker drive this call?

as one ZFL2 document, three rows, one claim:

    tainted     an attacker-controlled value reaches the sink          — from source facts
    sanitized   on EVERY path it was substituted by a verified value   — E40: no function launders a mark
    safe        := ~Tr(tainted) | Tr(sanitized)                        — claim: safe

and the judge answers with a **disposition and a weak link**, not a score:

| disposition | meaning |
|---|---|
| **REFUTED** | attacker-controlled value reaches the sink and nothing on the path substitutes it — an injection |
| **EARNED** | grounded: on the named substitution (`san-intval-L12`), or nothing attacker-controlled arrives |
| **OPEN** | the path crosses something this file cannot see; the weak link is **named** (`clean_input()@L4`, `param:$id`) |
| **E** | the file does not parse — *not judged*, never "clean" |

## Sight through calls (within a file)

A call to a function or `$this->method()` defined in the same file is
**inlined** with the caller's argument states (depth 3, recursion cut):
sinks inside are judged in the caller's context, the joined `return` state
comes back. `$this->prop` is a may-join over every assignment in the class.
A method that is called in the file is judged at its call sites; its
standalone reading — parameters Z — stands only when nothing calls it
(an entry point the framework calls). Other objects' properties, DB rows,
session data remain Z and the ledger names the object: `property $tpl`,
`->fetch()`.

Quoting is decided **once**, where an escaped part is first embedded; a
fragment then carries that decision, so `$q .= …`, `implode(",", $set)` and
a WHERE built in a helper are not re-judged as "outside quotes" by the
outer string (measured: 12 false REFUTED of one shape on the test engine
before this, 0 after — fixture `f26`).

## Measured against labelled corpora (2026-09-09)

`bench/` runs the instrument over the SARD / Stivalet suite (42 212 labelled files) and DVWA, and
Psalm 5 over the same files; the numbers, every remaining disagreement read in the source, and the
three defects found in the corpus itself are in [bench/README.md](bench/README.md). Headline, base
catalog: on CWE_89 the planted injections the instrument called "clean" went 204 → 0 and alarms on
fixed files 1053 → 90 (the 90 are five declared disagreements — `addslashes`, `htmlspecialchars`
and friends are not SQL substitutions); Psalm's 18 misses there are `mysqli_real_escape_string`
outside quotes. `html` now has sub-contexts, read by a lexer over the output stream (body text / quoted attribute / URL attribute /
`<script>` / unquoted): the substitution demanded depends on where a value lands, the way it depends on quotes for
SQL. On CWE_79 that moved the planted flaws called "clean" 1616 → 1152 (the rest are whitelist/numeric constructions
that survive any position) and false alarms 480 → 120. `html-sq` needs ENT_QUOTES, the default only since PHP 8.1 —
so `--php 7.4` changes the verdict.

## For a human: `--summary`

    python3 php2zfl.py path --summary summary.md

One table — file / sinks / REFUTED / OPEN / EARNED — then only the REFUTED
sinks, each with a one-line reason and its own line of code (never from a
config file). Everything else is in `--json`.

## The external denominator: `compare_psalm.py`

    CODE2ZFL_PSALM=/path/to/vendor/bin/psalm python3 compare_psalm.py --root /site modules libraries [--overlay proj.json] [--php 7.4]

Runs Psalm's taint analysis and php2zfl on the same tree and prints:
found / same lines / only Psalm (with what we said there) / only ours (by
context, with reasons). Every line Psalm has that we do not is either a
hole in the catalog or a defect in the judgement — the fixtures I write
can only test the questions I thought of. Psalm 5.x is needed on
PHP < 8.3.16.

## Why per-sink documents lose nothing

Evaluation reads the marking only at the atoms of the formula:
`lean/NoGift.lean` `evalF_congr`, `lean/ContextClosure.lean` `eval_indep`,
`lean/Receipt.lean` `receipt_complete` — all with empty axiom lists. Cutting
one big table into per-claim tables changes no verdict. The `3^names` cost of
the passport office never enters: these documents have three names.

## What is proved, what is measured, what is a boundary

- **Proved** (Lean, `[]`): a chain of functions never removes a mark; the only
  sanitizer is a *substitution* of the element — `lean/ZTaint.lean`
  `no_laundering`, `sanitizer_is_substitution`. The catalog encodes exactly
  that: `intval` substitutes for every context, `mysqli_real_escape_string`
  only for the quoted SQL context, `htmlspecialchars` only for HTML;
  `addslashes`, `substr`, `str_replace` substitute nothing.
- **Measured** (`test_php2zfl.py`): 31 fixture sink verdicts across 26 fixtures — planted injections
  REFUTED, clean code EARNED, opaque code OPEN with the weak link named — and
  two **vacuity controls**: with the sanitizer catalog emptied `f02` flips to
  REFUTED, with the source catalog emptied `f01` flips to OPEN. The catalog is
  load-bearing; the verdicts are not the frame talking.
- **Boundaries** (named in the ledger, not hidden):
  - *one file at a time*: calls within the file are followed; a global, an include, another object's property, a DB row are Z;
  - escaping **without quotes** is refuted, not credited (`ast-unquoted`);
  - a transformation after escaping **drops** it (`substr` can end in a lone backslash);
  - a sanitizer of the **wrong context** is refuted (HTML escaper before SQL);
  - the catalog carries `measured` per sink context — only `sql` is exercised by the stand so far.
- **Never emitted**: literal values. A string literal contributes two bits
  (does it begin / end with a quote). Secrets in config files cannot leak
  through this tool's output.

## Run

    composer install                                   # or: export CODE2ZFL_AUTOLOAD=/path/to/vendor/autoload.php
    python3 php2zfl.py path/to/code [--overlay project.json] [--ctx sql|all] [--md ledger.md] [--json facts.json]
    python3 test_php2zfl.py

`catalog.json` is the base PHP catalog — sources, sinks by context,
substitutions by context, transparent functions. A project **overlay** adds
its own wrapper (`$db->query`, `$db->escape`, `get_var`): see
`fixtures/overlay-wrapper.json`. Overlays for live sites stay private.

## Overlays: a framework is data

`overlays/laravel.json` — the Request object and `request()` helper as
sources; `DB::raw/select/statement` and the `*Raw` builder methods as
sinks; and the **identifier positions** — `orderBy($col)`, `where($col, …)`,
`select($cols)`, `groupBy($col)` — because the builder binds values and
never column names. Catalog keys may be receiver-qualified three ways:
`$db->safe`, `DB::raw`, `request()->input`. Blade templates are not parsed
as PHP sinks — a boundary, named in the overlay.

Second corpus (2026-09-08): a 41-file Laravel app — 72 sinks, 70 EARNED on
constants, 2 OPEN (a middleware's `$next` closure), 0 REFUTED; Psalm 0.
The tool does not cry wolf where the builder binds.

## Prior art, named once

Taint analysis exists — Psalm, PHPStan, Semgrep, Phan. What they do not give
is the **warrant**: their "clean" is unwarranted, ours is `EARNED on
san-intval-L12`; where they either assume or shout, ours says **Z** and names
the link to verify. Independent comparison on the same files is the next
measurement, not a claim made here.
